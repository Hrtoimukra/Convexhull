Convex hull are fundamental geometric structures that occurs in various areas such as pattern recognition,optimization,design automation etc.
Above project implements three classical algorithms for computing convex hull namely Quick Hull,Divide and Conquer and Grahams Scan.
It also implements popular randomized incremental algorithm for computing convex hull in 3d.
In case of 2d an online visualization tool "geodeb.h" is used.I
In case of 3d a simple python script is being used for rendering the points of convex hull in 3d.
