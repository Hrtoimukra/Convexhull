Convex hull are fundamental geometric structures that occurs in various areas such as pattern recognition,optimization,design automation etc.
Above project implements three classical algorithms for computing convex hull namely Quick Hull,Divide and Conquer and Grahams Scan.
Every program randomly generates set of 2D points and computes the convex hull.Each program uses an open source visualization tool "geodeb.h" .The program output is html file which will show the construction of convex hull in step by step manner
